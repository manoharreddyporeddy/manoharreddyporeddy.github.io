NUMBER SYSTEMS
1.1 Introduction
In your earlier classes, you have learnt about the number line and how to represent
various types of numbers on it (see Fig. 1.1).
Fig. 1.1 : The number line
Just imagine you start from zero and go on walking along this number line in the
positive direction. As far as your eyes can see, there are numbers, numbers and
numbers!
Fig. 1.2
Now suppose you start walking along the number line, and collecting some of the
numbers. Get a bag ready to store them!

You might begin with picking up only natural
numbers like 1, 2, 3, and so on. You know that this list
goes on for ever. (Why is this true?) So, now your
bag contains infinitely many natural numbers! Recall
that we denote this collection by the symbol N.
Now turn and walk all the way back, pick up
zero and put it into the bag. You now have the
collection of whole numbers which is denoted by
the symbol W.
Now, stretching in front of you are many, many negative integers. Put all the
negative integers into your bag. What is your new collection? Recall that it is the
collection of all integers, and it is denoted by the symbol Z.
Are there some numbers still left on the line? Of course! There are numbers like
1 3
,
2 4
, or even 2005

collection of rational numbers. The collection of rational numbers is denoted by Q.
‘Rational’ comes from the word ‘ratio’, and Q comes from the word ‘quotient’.
You may recall the definition of rational numbers:
A number ‘r’ is called a rational number, if it can be written in the form p
q ,
where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. (Why do we insist that q ≠ 0?)
Notice that all the numbers now in the bag can be written in the form p
q , where p
and q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, –25 can be written as 
25;
1
−
 here p = –25
and q = 1. Therefore, the rational numbers also include the natural numbers, whole
numbers and integers.
You also know that the rational numbers do not have a unique representation in
the form p
q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, 1
2  = 2
4  = 10
20  = 25
50
= 47
94 , and so on. These are equivalent rational numbers (or fractions). However,
when we say that p
q  is a rational number, or when we represent p
q  on the number
line, we assume that q ≠ 0 and that  p and q have no common factors other than 1
(that is, p and q are co-prime). So, on the number line, among the infinitely many
fractions equivalent to 1
2 , we will choose 1
2  to represent all of them.
Now, let us solve some examples about the different types of numbers, which you
have studied in earlier classes.
Example 1 : Are the following statements true or false? Give reasons for your answers.
(i)
Every whole number is a natural number.
(ii) Every integer is a rational number.
(iii) Every rational number is an integer.
Solution : (i) False, because zero is a whole number but not a natural number.
(ii) True, because every integer m can be expressed in the form 1
m , and so it is a
rational number.
2024-25
4
MATHEMATICS
(iii) False, because 3
5  is not an integer.
Example 2 : Find five rational numbers between 1 and 2.
We can approach this problem in at least two ways.
Solution 1 : Recall that to find a rational number between r and s, you can add r and
s and divide the sum by 2, that is 
2
r
s
+
 lies between r and s. So, 3
2  is a number
between 1 and 2. You can proceed in this manner to find four more rational numbers
between 1 and 2. These four numbers are 5 11 13
7.
,
,
and
4
8
8
4
Solution 2 : The other option is to find all the five rational numbers in one step. Since
we want five numbers, we write 1 and 2 as rational numbers with denominator 5 + 1,
i.e., 1 = 6
6  and 2 = 12
6 . Then you can check that 7
6 , 8
6 , 9
6 , 10
6  and 11
6  are all rational
numbers between 1 and 2. So, the five numbers are 7 4 3 5
11
,
,
,
and
6 3 2 3
6 .
Remark : Notice that in Example 2, you were asked to find five rational numbers
between 1 and 2. But, you must have realised that in fact there are infinitely many
rational numbers between 1 and 2. In general, there are infinitely many rational
numbers between any two given rational numbers.
Let us take a look at the number line again. Have you picked up all the numbers?
Not, yet. The fact is that there are infinitely many more numbers left on the number
line! There are gaps in between the places of the numbers you picked up, and not just
one or two but infinitely many. The amazing thing is that there are infinitely many
numbers lying between any two of these gaps too!
So we are left with the following questions:
1. What are the numbers, that are left on the number
line, called?
2. How do we recognise them? That is, how do we
distinguish them from the rationals (rational
numbers)?
These questions will be answered in the next section.

1.2 Irrational Numbers
We saw, in the previous section, that there may be numbers on the number line that
are not rationals. In this section, we are going to investigate these numbers. So far, all
the numbers you have come across, are of the form p
q , where p and q are integers
and q ≠ 0. So, you may ask: are there numbers which are not of this form? There are
indeed such numbers.
The Pythagoreans in Greece, followers of the famous
mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras, were the first
to discover the numbers which were not rationals, around
400 BC. These numbers are called irrational numbers
(irrationals), because they cannot be written in the form of
a ratio of integers. There are many myths surrounding the
discovery of irrational numbers by the Pythagorean,
Hippacus of Croton. In all the myths, Hippacus has an
unfortunate end, either for discovering that 
2  is irrational
or for disclosing the secret about 
2  to people outside the
secret Pythagorean sect!
 Let us formally define these numbers.
A number ‘s’ is called irrational, if it cannot be written in the form p
q , where p
and q are integers and q ≠ 0.

You already know that there are infinitely many rationals. It turns out that there
are infinitely many irrational numbers too. Some examples are:
2,
3,
15, π, 0.10110111011110...
Remark : Recall that when we use the symbol 
, we assume that it is the
positive square root of the number. So 
4  = 2, though both 2 and –2 are square
roots of 4.
Some of the irrational numbers listed above are familiar to you. For example, you
have already come across many of the square roots listed above and the number π.
The Pythagoreans proved that 
2  is irrational. Later in approximately 425 BC,
Theodorus of Cyrene showed that 3,
5,
6,
7,
10,
11,
12,
13, 14,
15
and 17  are also irrationals. Proofs of irrationality of 
2 , 
3 , 
5 , etc., shall be
discussed in Class X.  As to π, it was known to various cultures for thousands of
years, it was proved to be irrational by Lambert and Legendre only in the late 1700s.
In the next section, we will discuss why 0.10110111011110... and π are irrational.
Let us return to the questions raised at the end of
the previous section. Remember the bag of rational
numbers. If we now put all irrational numbers into
the bag, will there be any number left on the number
line? The answer is no! It turns out that the collection
of all rational numbers and irrational numbers together
make up what we call the collection of real numbers,
which is denoted by R. Therefore, a real number is either rational or irrational. So, we
can say that every real number is represented by a unique point on the number
line. Also, every point on the number line represents a unique real number.
This is why we call the number line, the real number line.
In the 1870s two German mathematicians,
Cantor and Dedekind, showed that :
Corresponding to every real number, there is a
point on the real number line, and corresponding
to every point on the number line, there exists a
unique real number.

Let us see how we can locate some of the irrational numbers on the number line.
Example 3 : Locate 
2  on the number line.
Solution : It is easy to see how the Greeks might have discovered
2 . Consider a square OABC, with each side 1 unit in length (see
Fig. 1.6). Then you can see by the Pythagoras theorem that
OB = 
2

. How do we represent 
2  on the number line?
This is easy. Transfer Fig. 1.6 onto the number line making sure that the vertex O
coincides with zero (see Fig. 1.7).
Fig. 1.7
We have just seen that OB = 
2 . Using a compass with centre O and radius OB,
draw an arc intersecting the number line at the point P. Then P corresponds to 
2  on
the number line.
Example 4 : Locate 
3  on the number line.
Solution : Let us return to Fig. 1.7.
Fig. 1.8
Construct BD of unit length perpendicular to OB (as in Fig. 1.8). Then using the
Pythagoras theorem, we see that OD = (

Classroom activity (Constructing the ‘square root

the ‘square root spiral’ in the following fashion. Start
with a point O and draw a line segment OP1 of unit
length. Draw a line segment P1P2 perpendicular to
OP1 of unit length (see Fig. 1.9). Now draw a line
segment P2P3 perpendicular to OP2. Then draw a line
segment P3P4 perpendicular to OP3. Continuing in
this manner, you can get the line segment Pn–1Pn by
drawing a line segment of unit length perpendicular to OPn–1. In this manner, you will
have created the points P2, P3,...., Pn,... ., and joined them to create a beautiful spiral
depicting 2,

1.3 Real Numbers and their Decimal Expansions
In this section, we are going to study rational and irrational numbers from a different
point of view. We will look at the decimal expansions of real numbers and see if we
can use the expansions to distinguish between rationals and irrationals. We will also
explain how to visualise the representation of real numbers on the number line using
their decimal expansions. Since rationals are more familiar to us, let us start with
them. Let us take three examples :

Divisor : 8

What have you noticed? You should have noticed at least three things:
(i)
The remainders either become 0 after a certain stage, or start repeating themselves.
(ii)
The number of entries in the repeating string of remainders is less than the divisor
(in 10
3  one number repeats itself and the divisor is 3, in 1
7  there are six entries
326451 in the repeating string of remainders and 7 is the divisor).
(iii) If the remainders repeat, then we get a repeating block of digits in the quotient
(for 10
3 , 3 repeats in the quotient and for 1
7 , we get the repeating block 142857
in the quotient).
2024-25
10
MATHEMATICS
Although we have noticed this pattern using only the examples above, it is true for all
rationals of the form p
q  (q ≠ 0). On division of p by q, two main things happen – either
the remainder becomes zero or never becomes zero and we get a repeating string of
remainders. Let us look at each case separately.
Case (i) : The remainder becomes zero
In the example of 7
8 , we found that the remainder becomes zero after some steps and
the decimal expansion of 7
8  = 0.875. Other examples are 1
2  = 0.5, 639
250  = 2.556. In all
these cases, the decimal expansion terminates or ends after a finite number of steps.
We call the decimal expansion of such numbers terminating.
Case (ii) : The remainder never becomes zero
In the examples of 10
3  and 1
7 , we notice that the remainders repeat after a certain
stage forcing the decimal expansion to go on for ever. In other words, we have a
repeating block of digits in the quotient. We say that this expansion is non-terminating
recurring. For example, 10
3  = 3.3333... and 1
7  = 0.142857142857142857...
The usual way of showing that 3 repeats in the quotient of 10
3  is to write it as 3.3.
Similarly, since the block of digits 142857 repeats in the quotient of 1
7 , we write 1
7  as
0.142857 , where the bar above the digits indicates the block of digits that repeats.
Also 3.57272... can be written as 3.572 . So, all these examples give us non-terminating
recurring (repeating) decimal expansions.
Thus, we see that the decimal expansion of rational numbers have only two choices:
either they are terminating or non-terminating recurring.
Now suppose, on the other hand, on your walk on the number line, you come across a
number like 3.142678 whose decimal expansion is terminating or a number like
1.272727... that is, 1.27 , whose decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring, can
you conclude that it is a rational number? The answer is yes!
2024-25
NUMBER SYSTEMS
11
We will not prove it but illustrate this fact with a few examples. The terminating cases
are easy.
Example 6 : Show that 3.142678 is a rational number. In other words, express 3.142678
in the form p
q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.
Solution : We have 3.142678 = 3142678
1000000
, and hence is a rational number.
Now, let us consider the case when the decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring.
Example 7 : Show that 0.3333... = 03.  can be expressed in the form p
q , where p and
q are integers and q ≠ 0.
Solution : Since we do not know what 03.  is , let us call it ‘x’ and so
x = 0.3333...
Now here is where the trick comes in. Look at
10 x = 10 × (0.333...) = 3.333...
Now,
3.3333... = 3 + x, since x = 0.3333...
Therefore,
10 x = 3 + x
Solving for x, we get
9x = 3, i.e., x = 1
3
Example 8 : Show that 1.272727... = 1 27
.
 can be expressed in the form p
q , where p
and q are integers and q ≠ 0.
Solution : Let x = 1.272727... Since two digits are repeating, we multiply x by 100 to
get
100 x = 127.2727...
So,
100 x = 126 + 1.272727... = 126 + x
Therefore,
100 x – x = 126, i.e., 99 x = 126
2024-25
12
MATHEMATICS
i.e.,
x = 126
14
99
11
=
You can check the reverse that 14
11  = 1 27
.
.
Example 9 : Show that 0.2353535... = 0 235
.
 can be expressed in the form p
q ,
where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.
Solution : Let x = 0 235
.
. Over here, note that 2 does not repeat, but the block 35
repeats. Since two digits are repeating, we multiply x by 100 to get
100 x = 23.53535...
So,
100 x = 23.3 + 0.23535... = 23.3 + x
Therefore,
99 x = 23.3
i.e.,
99 x = 233
10
, which gives x = 233
990
You can also check the reverse that 233
990  = 0 235
.
.
So, every number with a non-terminating recurring decimal expansion can be expressed
in the form p
q  (q ≠ 0), where p and q are integers. Let us summarise our results in the
following form :
The decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or non-
terminating recurring. Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is
terminating or non-terminating recurring is rational.
So, now we know what the decimal expansion of a rational number can be. What
about the decimal expansion of irrational numbers? Because of the property above,
we can conclude that their decimal expansions are non-terminating non-recurring.
So, the property for irrational numbers, similar to the property stated above for rational
numbers, is
The decimal expansion of an irrational number is non-terminating non-recurring.
Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is non-terminating non-recurring
is irrational.
2024-25
NUMBER SYSTEMS
13
Recall s = 0.10110111011110... from the previous section. Notice that it is non-
terminating and non-recurring. Therefore, from the property above, it is irrational.
Moreover, notice that you can generate infinitely many irrationals similar to s.
What about the famous irrationals 
2  and π? Here are their decimal expansions up
to a certain stage.
2  = 1.4142135623730950488016887242096...
   π = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950...
(Note that, we often take 22
7  as an approximate value for π, but π ≠ 22
7 .)
Over the years, mathematicians have developed various techniques to produce more
and more digits in the decimal expansions of irrational numbers. For example, you
might have learnt to find digits in the decimal expansion of 2  by the division method.
Interestingly, in the Sulbasutras (rules of chord), a mathematical treatise of the Vedic
period (800 BC - 500 BC), you find an approximation of 
2  as follows:
2  =

Notice that it is the same as the one given above for the first five decimal places. The
history of the hunt for digits in the decimal expansion of π is very interesting.
The Greek genius Archimedes was the first to compute
digits in the decimal expansion of π. He showed 3.140845
< π < 3.142857. Aryabhatta (476 – 550 C.E.), the great
Indian mathematician and astronomer, found the value
of π correct to four decimal places (3.1416). Using high
speed computers and advanced algorithms, π has been
computed to over 1.24 trillion decimal places!
Now, let us see how to obtain irrational numbers.

1.4 Operations on Real Numbers
You have learnt, in earlier classes, that rational numbers satisfy the commutative,
associative and distributive laws for addition and multiplication. Moreover, if we add,
subtract, multiply or divide (except by zero) two rational numbers, we still get a rational
number (that is, rational numbers are ‘closed’ with respect to addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division). It turns out that irrational numbers also satisfy the
commutative, associative and distributive laws for addition and multiplication. However,
the sum, difference, quotients and products of irrational numbers are not always
irrational. For example, (

(

) (

3
,

⋅
 and 
17
17  are
rationals.
Let us look at what happens when we add and multiply a rational number with an
irrational number. For example, 3  is irrational. What about 2
3
+
 and 2 3 ? Since
3  has a non-terminating non-recurring decimal expansion, the same is true for
2
3
+
 and 2 3 . Therefore, both 2
3
+
 and 2 3  are also irrational numbers.
Example 11 : Check whether 7 5 , 7
2
21
2
5
,
,
+
π −
 are irrational numbers or
not.
Solution : 
5  = 2.236... , 
2  = 1.4142..., π = 3.1415...
Then 7 5  = 15.652..., 
7
5  = 
7 5
7 5
5
5 5
=
 = 3.1304...
2  + 21 = 22.4142..., π – 2 = 1.1415...
All these are non-terminating non-recurring decimals. So, all these are irrational numbers.
Now, let us see what generally happens if we add, subtract, multiply, divide, take
square roots and even nth roots of these irrational numbers, where n is any natural
number. Let us look at some examples.

These examples may lead you to expect the following facts, which are true:
(i)
The sum or difference of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational.
(ii) The product or quotient of a non-zero rational number with an irrational number is
irrational.
(iii) If we add, subtract, multiply or divide two irrationals, the result may be rational or
irrational.
We now turn our attention to the operation of taking square roots of real numbers.
Recall that, if a is a natural number, then 
a
b
=
 means b2 = a and b > 0. The same
definition can be extended for positive real numbers.
Let a > 0 be a real number. Then 
a  = b means b2 = a and b > 0.
In Section 1.2, we saw how to represent n  for any positive integer n on the number
line. We now show how to find 
x  for any given positive real number x geometrically.
For example, let us find it for x = 3.5, i.e., we find 3 5.  geometrically.
Fig. 1.11
Mark the distance 3.5 units from a fixed point A on a given line to obtain a point B such
that AB = 3.5 units (see Fig. 1.11). From B, mark a distance of 1 unit and mark the
new point as C. Find the mid-point of AC and mark that point as O. Draw a semicircle
with centre O and radius OC. Draw a line perpendicular to AC passing through B and
intersecting the semicircle at D. Then, BD = 3.5 .
2024-25
NUMBER SYSTEMS
17
More generally, to find 
x , for any positive real
number x, we mark B so that AB = x units, and, as in
Fig. 1.12, mark C so that BC = 1 unit. Then, as we
have done for the case x = 3.5, we find BD = 
x
(see Fig. 1.12). We can prove this result using the
Pythagoras Theorem.
Notice that, in Fig. 1.12, ∆ OBD is a right-angled triangle. Also, the radius of the circle
is 
1
2
x +
 units.
Therefore, OC = OD = OA = 
1
2
x +
 units.
Now, OB =

.
This shows that BD = 
x .
This construction gives us a visual, and geometric way of showing that 
x  exists for
all real numbers x > 0. If you want to know the position of 
x  on the number line,
then let us treat the line BC as the number line, with B as zero, C as 1, and so on.
Draw an arc with centre B and radius BD, which intersects the number line in E
(see Fig. 1.13). Then, E represents 
x .

MATHEMATICS
We would like to now extend the idea of square roots to cube roots, fourth roots,
and in general nth roots, where n is a positive integer. Recall your understanding of
square roots and cube roots from earlier classes.
What is 3 8 ? Well, we know it has to be some positive number whose cube is 8, and
you must have guessed 3 8  = 2. Let us try 5 243 . Do you know some number b such
that b5 = 243? The answer is 3. Therefore, 5 243  = 3.
From these examples, can you define n a  for a real number a > 0 and a positive
integer n?
Let a > 0 be a real number and n be a positive integer. Then n a  = b, if bn = a and
b > 0. Note that the symbol ‘
’ used in 
3
2,
8, n a , etc. is called the radical sign.
We now list some identities relating to square roots, which are useful in various
ways. You are already familiar with some of these from your earlier classes. The
remaining ones follow from the distributive law of multiplication over addition of real
numbers, and from the identity (x + y) (x – y) = x2 – y2, for any real numbers x and y.
Let a and b be positive real numbers. Then

expression should be written as the sum of a rational and an irrational number.
We end this section by considering the following problem. Look at

⋅ Can you tell
where it shows up on the number line? You know that it is irrational. May be it is easier
to handle if the denominator is a rational number. Let us see, if we can ‘rationalise’ the
denominator, that is, to make the denominator into a rational number. To do so, we
need the identities involving square roots. Let us see how.
Example 16 : Rationalise the denominator of 
1
2
⋅
Solution : We want to write 
1
2  as an equivalent expression in which the denominator

2  is rational. We also know that multiplying
1
2  by 
2
2  will give us an equivalent expression, since 
2
2  = 1. So, we put these two
facts together to get

So, when the denominator of an expression contains a term with a square root (or
a number under a radical sign), the process of converting it to an equivalent expression
whose denominator is a rational number is called rationalising the denominator.

that we have studied earlier, even when the base is a positive real number and the
exponents are rational numbers. (Later you will study that it can further to be extended
when the exponents are real numbers.) But before we state these laws, and to even
make sense of these laws, we need to first understand what, for example 
3
2
4  is. So,
we have some work to do!
We define n a  for a real number a > 0 as follows:
Let a > 0 be a real number and n a positive integer. Then n a  = b, if bn = a and
b > 0.
In the language of exponents, we define n a  =

a . So, in particular,

MATHEMATICS
1.6 Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
1.
A number r is called a rational number, if it can be written in the form p
q , where p and q are
integers and q ≠ 0.
2.
A number s is called a irrational number, if it cannot be written in the form p
q , where p and
q are integers and q ≠ 0.
3.
The decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or non-terminating recurring.
Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is terminating or non-terminating recurring
is rational.
4.
The decimal expansion of an irrational number is non-terminating non-recurring. Moreover,
a number whose decimal expansion is non-terminating non-recurring is irrational.
5.
All the rational and irrational numbers make up the collection of real numbers.
6.
If r is rational and s is irrational, then r + s and r – s are irrational numbers, and rs and r
s  are
irrational numbers, r ≠ 0.
