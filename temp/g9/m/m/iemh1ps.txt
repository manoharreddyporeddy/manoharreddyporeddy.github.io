FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005, recommends that children’s life
at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure
from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes
a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed
on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also
attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between
different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in
the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the national Policy on
Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers
will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative
activities and questions. We must recognize that, given space, time and freedom, children
generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.
Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key
reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity
and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not
as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
This aims imply considerable change is school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual
calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.
The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this
textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather then a
source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of
curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with
greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The
textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to
opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities
requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates
the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book.
We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics,
Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor P. Sinclair of
IGNOU, New Delhi for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed
2024-25
to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this
possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organizations which have generously
permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially
grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the
Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource
Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P.
Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation committed to
systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT
welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision
and refinement.

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOKS
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students.
The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and
providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this
background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks
across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across
classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:
•
Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class
•
Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject
•
Difficulty level
•
Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from
teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning
•
Content, which is irrelevant in the present context
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes
given above.
