	I think you need to know distributed databases, consistent hashing, partition strategies, etc.
	You need to know metadata management, load balancing, distributed queuing, data synchronization, and others.
	With those, you should be able to build fairly complex systems, probably more than enough for the interview.

sys design?

system design (SD)
	Just don't lie, talk about your real experiences, they will know otherwise.

How to answer System design for project?
	Interviewer:
	Tell in a simple way. Other person might not know what is RabbitMQ, so tell in terms of "queue" which everyone understands. Tell the answer in simple coree basic blocks (queue, producer, consumer, database, etc)

	The system design preparation will make you think of high level components,
	think how those components interact with eachother,
	what happens when they fail.
	It will make you think of the architecture of your own features and
		systems without really thinking about it,
	as it will be in your brain all the time.

	Question related to Computer Science Fundamentals :
	1 .Operating System questions related to
		mutex-semaphore, deadlock, bankerâ€™s algorithm, Paging and Page Replacement Algorithms.
	2. Difference between SQL and NoSQL
	3. Questions on 
			multithreading , synchronization , class level and object level locking
	4. Memory management (Java memory structure) ,
			Garbage collection (Popular garbage collection strategies and algorithms) ,
			Collection framework in Java ,
			String class related concepts like SCP (String Constants Pool) ,
			String intern() method
	5. Java 8 features (Streams , Lambda , Fucntional programming , Method references)

	sys design
		dont over think
		there is only so much u can do abt sys design, so focus more on coding

	I was referring to ways to manage your data. Some time you write data on a distributed database, but the metadata of it can be written in a SQL DB. Sometimes is not enough to say that you will use a distributed system, you might additionally need to somehow efficiently manage the metadata in order to get the requirements in place. This seems obvious or trivial, but many people completely ignore this.

	- Messaging systems like RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SQS
	- REST APIs/services
	- Experience in following is a plus
	- Time series db, graph db is a plus
	- Event processing engine is a plus
	- Amazon web services
	- Multi tenant SaaS applications
	- Microservices design

	- Design Twitter
	- Write a method/function to hand out reservations to an EC2-like service.
	- Design an system that generates unique keys.
- Discuss trade-offs intelligently. There are very few absolutes in software design at any level - from function signature through N-tier architecture.
