        Distributivity property
                of   Multiplication    over   Addition and Subtraction.
        =======================
            a * (b+c) =  a*b  +  a*c
            a * (b-c) =  a*b  -  a*c
<hr/>
    0 is the additive       identity for whole, natural, integers and rational numbers.
        a+0 = a

    1 is the multiplicative identity for whole, natural, integers and rational numbers.
        a*1 = a

    So
        -a is additive inverse  of a
            a   +   -a  = 0
    And
        1/a is multiplicative inverse  of a
            a   *   1/a = 1

        Algebraic equation is     equality involving variables
        Algebraic equation is     equation is the equality of the values of two expressions

    Linear expressions = highest power of the variable appearing in the expression is 1
    Linear equations in one variable = equations with linear expressions in one variable only

    Solutions of the equation
    Values of the variable for which equation the values of the expressions on the LHS and RHS are equal

    Equations having the Variable on both Sides

    Solve
    Check lhs = rhs

    Numbers and variables be transposed from one side of the equation to the other.
